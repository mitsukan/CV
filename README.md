## Skills

#### Problem solving

I have developed a strong sense of pragmaticism during my time working in accountancy, serving me well while I was working as an accountanting trainee and during the start-up. I place great importance in understanding the nuances and interpretations of any problem, and strive to provide solutions that best fit the needs of the situation.

#### Communication

Communication was key during my time as an accountant, as I would meet clients from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and industries. From language barriers to varying levels of financial literacy, it was important not only to pick up these details when liasing with these clients, but also to convey them to colleagues to ensure we have covered all the bases.

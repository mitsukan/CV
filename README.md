A recent graduate of Makers Academy, I am a junior software developer looking for a work environment with a rich community, great opportunities and support for learning.
I was previously a trainee accountant with experience in bookkeeping, accounting, tax and client management, and a co-founder of a small accounting firm working with small and medium sized clients.

## Skills

#### Problem solving
My previous job as an accounting heavily involved problem solving. On top of processing information and working on accounts, we also dealt with individual client requirements and navigating the complexities of taxation. I've been able to apply this to my coding, from applying TDD to solve group work logistics and challenges.

#### Communication

Communication was key during my time as an accountant, as I would meet clients from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and industries. A large part of my role was translating from layman to technical specifications. This skill has shown to be invaluable when working with other people while coding, being able to communicate with people of varying technical knowledge to meet goals at Makers Academy.

#### Learning

I have found my learning experience significantly enhanced by the pairing and group work at Makers Academy. Being taught by someone of a similar knowledge level helps with understanding, while teaching pair partners has helped me solidify knowledge. Reading, practice and experimentation drives my learning outside of working with people.

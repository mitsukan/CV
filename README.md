## Skills

#### Problem solving
My previous job as an accounting heavily involved problem solving. On top of processing information and working on accounts, we also dealt with individual client requirements and navigating the complexities of taxation. I've been able to apply this to my coding, from applying TDD to solve group work logistics and challenges.

#### Communication

Communication was key during my time as an accountant, as I would meet clients from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and industries. A large part of my role was translating from layman to technical specifications. This skill has shown to be invaluable when working with other people while coding, being able to communicate with people of varying technical knowledge to meet goals at Makers Academy.

I go to rock climbing gyms when my body allows it, and read sci-fi and spend time on driving simulators when it doesn't.
I dabble in philosophy books in my spare time and enjoy meditating to unwind.
